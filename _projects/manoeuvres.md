Manoeuvres is an artistic project, site-specific, that intervenes in old urban industrial spaces through image and sound. The artists will "listen" to the space of the old factories, and reclaim the story of the productive masses. It is not a nostalgic action, or a revision of past times, it is about inserting temporality, incorporating the past as one more layer to the collective story. The aim is to print the memory imprint of work in the white cube of the artistic space, and to question its neutrality during the process.

For Manoeuvers 5 in Roeselare, we propose a sound walk through the past of manual work at the old Rodenbach's brewery, listening to the echoes and vibrations hidden in the objects and materials that accompanied a large part of the lives of several generations of working bodies.

##### Bio
**Marta Azparren** is a visual artist and performer based in Barcelona. Her videos have been screened and awarded in numerous international film and video festivals, exhibitions and art fairs. Her work claims to be a meta-reflection on the artistic activity, with special attention to the connections between creator, spectator and object, and its mediators.  

**Pablo Martin Jones** is the son of a flamenco guitarist and a flamenco dancer, both Americans living in Spain. His approach broadened as he grew musically, and he developed a wider palette of sounds, that includes practically anything, while simultaneously immersing himself in electronic music. During this time he has performed with many great artists from many different fields, in many different styles and is increasingly in demand as a composer for film, dance and other performing arts.
