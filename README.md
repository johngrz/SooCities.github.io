Welcome to the ever-evolving, developer-led digital catalog of the Sound of our Cities project.
# Introduction
 One of the objectives of the project is technology transfer. AAU has made a template for showcasing the SooC sound works, and deployed the works online with a CC-License on [GitHub](https://github.com/): a web-based platform for version control using `git`. You can think Github also as a social media for developers: users can collaborate on or adopt open-source projects, fork code, share ideas and more. Here, you can maintain, extend, augment your project after the SooC lifetime. It is also easy and free to set-up a GitHub account and host your own portfolio using [GitHub-pages](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/github-pages-free-hosting/).

Simple prerequisite for these are:

1. Have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

2. Have knowledge on how to use [Git and GitHub](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/git-and-github-for-beginners/).

3. Understand how [GitHub-pages](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/github-pages-free-hosting/) work: Free hosting as well though this is not mandatory.

4. Familiarize with (Github-flavored) markdown for editing your content. A comprensive guide is at https://github.github.com/gfm and a quick start at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
