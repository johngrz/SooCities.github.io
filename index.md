SOUNDS OF OUR CITIES is a CREATIVE Europe cooperation project, based upon research and the transfer of knowledge among the spheres of art, technology and social space. It is led by the [City of Roeselare](https://www.roeselare.be), [Idensitat](https://www.idensitat.net), [Dear Hunter](https://dearhunter.eu) and [Aalborg Universitet](https://www.smc.aau.dk). The project focuses on two local contexts (Krottegem in Roeselare and Sant Andreu in Barcelona), as a critical reflection upon cultural identity in relation to the concepts of community and silence.

The project begun with an open call that offered a residence to 10 artists (5 to Roeselare and 5 in Barcelona). Selected projects were developed within each city’s social context as well as through a residence. Within the framework of SoOC, various mediation activities are taking place throughout the chosen locations, and two exhibitions held in each city:

- ROESELARE 22-30.10.21 (O.L. Vrouwemarkt, 30 )
- BARCELONA 11-21.11.21 (Gran de Sant Andreu, 111)
